# iOSDevCamp Colorado Code of Conduct

iOSDevCamp Colorado is open to anyone interested in iOS development, and we have always welcomed and encouraged participation by anyone. Right up to the point where one person’s participation infringes on another person’s enjoyment and participation, that is.

It’s tempting to just say “don’t be an ass, be nice to people” and leave it at that, but it helps to be more specific than that. So in order to make sure there are absolutely no misunderstandings about our events:

**iOSDevCamp Colorado is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference at the discretion of the conference organizers.**
