iOSDevCamp is an informal conference-style event for iOS app developers of all skill levels. The event is on a Friday evening and then all day Saturday:

- Friday evening, 6:30PM - 9:30PM: Socialize, network, hang out, and plan for Saturday
- Saturday, 9AM - 6PM: All day presentations, demos, and workshops from the best damn iOS developers in Colorado. Exact schedule TBD, but it’s always a day full of awesome. 

We’ll provide Friday night drinks, and coffee and lunch on Saturday. For those who want to explore, a wide array of eating and drinking establishments are close by.

**Dates are TBD due to COVID-19 concerns.** We had hoped to return in the spring, as we've done in the past. We'll return as soon as it seems safe.
