Ever thought about doing a conference talk? _This is your lucky day!_ This is a participatory event, and the more people who participate, the better the event for everyone.

iOSDevCamp Colorado is a learing experience for everyone involved, **including speakers**. If you've never done a talk before, you can start with us. No really, _you can do it_. We're happy to help you put a talk together. If you prefer to do it yourself, that's awesome too.

You don't need to be an expert. Our attendees have a wide range of experience. Beginner level talks are extremely welcome.

### Topics and Formats

Topics can be anything of interest to an audience of iOS software developers. Technical topics are most common, but relevant non-technical sessions are good too. Anything that's not obviously marketing-oriented is fair game.

Talks fall into two groups: general presentations and blitz talks.

General presentations can be slide-oriented talks, Xcode-oriented demos, or pretty much whatever works. They usually run 25-50 minutes, but more or less is OK if you let us know in advance (for scheduling purposes). Blitz talks are short 5-minute presentations. They're good for short topics, and also for people unaccustomed to speaking in front of a group (you know it'll be over quick!).

We don't need to see slides or detailed summaries in advance. We *do* need to know what you'd like to cover, and what format you prefer.
